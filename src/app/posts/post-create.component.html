<!-- [(NgModel)] is a two way binding. It does the setting and reading of a value. It will listen to an input and emit that data to us and store new data in that text area or output it there..   -->
<!-- We bind [(NgModel)] to a new defined property called enteredValue and it is in ts file -->
<textarea rows="6" [(ngModel)]="enteredValue"></textarea>
